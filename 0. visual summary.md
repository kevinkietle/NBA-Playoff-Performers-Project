NBA Playoff Performers Project
==============================

[Here is a link to a Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBAPlayoffPerformersProject/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) I created to provide a visual to the learnings I have found and shared in this project. In the dashboard, you're able to click on a certain bar to bring up that player's stats in the other visualizations, the stats that our models found to have statistically significant correlation to WS/48 differences. In the final tabs, you can also see the players that belong to each cluster.
